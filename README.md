# IoT Raspberry Sensors
In this project I've stored data in the IBM cloud from the Raspberry sensors and then I've printed the data in Apache Spark.

This project is a tutorial step by step explained in "MEMORIA.pdf".

Coming soon:
- To talk with a chatbot to obtain other measures like max, min, humidity etc
- Use our voice to talk with the chatbot
- Obtain data from Watson API and show them on Excel

Thx!
